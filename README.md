# Self-Driving_Cars_A_Minimalist_approach
Behaviour cloning and autonomous driving capabilities on a toy car

# msc-data-science-project-2019-20-files-aelshi01

As A part of my MSc project I am aiming to construct a minimalist approach to building a miniature self-driving car with basic capabilities that can be tested in a constructed environment.

The project will be split in two parts: 

#### (1) Behavior cloning using a simulator 

#### (2) Constructing a mini toy car with self-driving capabilities
 
 
# Behavior Cloning
 
 Behavior cloning will consist of the following:
 
 #### (1) generate data
 #### (2) Train and create a CNN to drive vehicle autonmously in the simulator
 #### (3) Test the CNN in autonomous mode in unseen tracks
 
 # Miniature self-driving car
 
 For this stage there will be two parts:
 
 #### (1) hardware
 #### (2) software
 
 # Testing
 
 For testing I have broken it into a two part process which will consist of testing in a simulator and empirical testing on the track.
